# ## Summary

#
# citeplasm/Router is a dojo/hash-based URL router as part of Citeplasm's MVC
# approach, based on Colin Snover's dbp.Router.
#
# Router allows individual routes to include both query and path string
# parameters which are then available inside the handling function. Here is an
# example of url routes and paths that resolve to them:
#
#     /docs/:id         ->      #/docs/12345
#     /search           ->      #/search?query=polymerase
#
# A route has three components: a regular expression string representing the
# path of the route, a method handler that is invoked each time the route is
# matched, and a boolean value indicating whether this value should be
# considered the default. 
#
# The route handler method is a function that takes two parameters: an object
# containing the parameters pulled from the route path, and an object
# containing information about the route that invoked the method handler.
#
# If no default is specified, the first route provided becomes the default.
#
# Example usage:
#
#     router = new Router [
#             path: "/docs/:id"
#             defaultRoute: true
#             handler: (params, route) ->
#                 console.log "Inside the route"
#         ,
#             path: "/search"
#             defaultRoute: false
#             handler: (params, route) ->
#                 console.log "Inside the route"
#     ]

        # The first parameter (path) is either a String or Regex that
